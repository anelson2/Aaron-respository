For Hmwk 1: I ran out of time and didn't get to programming in R. I spent a considerable amount of time 
figuring out how to get set up on my computer: downloading R, R studio, Protext, Slack, and figuring out
how to make a PDF of my hand-written homework answers and uploading them to git hub, which I eventually 
succeeded in doing. I wish I could've gotten to the programming!
